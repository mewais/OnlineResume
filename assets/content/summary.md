## Summary

I'm currently doing my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I have earned my MASc degree from the University of British Columbia, and before that I finished my BSc from Alexandria University.

I have a general interest in Digital Design, FPGAs, Computer Architecture, Cloud Architecture and Datacenters, and CAD tools. I have 1+ years of industry experience in LLVM compiler development, 3 years of research experience in CPU microarchitecture and memory hierarchy optimizations, and 3+ years of experience in ASIC/FPGA design flows. My current research is focused on data center architecture, virtualization and use of FPGAs in the datacenter.

Outside engineering, I have a general interest in Finance and Economics, I'm currently trying to pursue this by taking Coursera courses and auditing finance courses at UofT.
