## Summary

I'm currently doing my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I have earned my MASc degree from the University of British Columbia, and before that I finished my BSc from Alexandria University.

I am currently focused on exploring disaggregated memory architecture for datacenter. I possess a strong passion for computer architecture, digital design, and CAD tools. With a comprehensive background spanning hardware and software, I have accumulated over 3 years of experience in ASIC/FPGA design, conducted research in computer architecture and memory hierarchy optimizations for 4+ years, and contributed to LLVM-based compiler development for over 1 year.
