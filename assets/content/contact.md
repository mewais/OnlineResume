## Contact Me

I'm almost always available at my desk every weekday. Except, of course, when I'm giving tutorials or labs or attending meetings. If you need help with anything, please check my calendar, and email me with a good time before zooming/dropping in. Unless you're in a different time zone, never pick a time after 6PM.
