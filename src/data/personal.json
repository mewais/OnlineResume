  "summary": "I'm currently doing my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, I also work as a ML/HPC Architect at AMD. I have earned my MASc degree from the University of British Columbia, and before that I finished my BSc from Alexandria University.\n\nIn my PhD, I am currently focused on exploring disaggregated memory architecture for datacenter. At AMD, I work on designing/architecting a line of datacenter GPUs to better support machine learning applications. I possess a strong passion for computer architecture, digital design, and CAD tools. With a comprehensive background spanning hardware and software, I have accumulated over 3 years of experience in ASIC/FPGA design, conducted research in computer architecture and memory hierarchy optimizations for 5+ years in both academia and industry, and contributed to LLVM-based compiler development for over 1 year.",
